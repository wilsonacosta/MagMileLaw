Our clients have ranged from small one person proprietorships to Fortune 500 companies from all corners of the United States and Europe.  We understand the processes and pitfalls of how business is done and know that, often times, the management of these complex disputes can be time consuming and expensive. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At <strong>MAG MILE LAW</strong> our goal is to win and to do so as efficiently and timely as possible.  If settlement makes sense, we settle, however, if trial is necessary we go to trial.  We focus on the facts and the law and do what is needed.  We do not litigate to simply bill the client and then work out a settlement. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Preparation and working closely with our clients towards exceeding their short term and long term needs is a hallmark of our practice. The business world is difficult enough, and MAG MILE LAW helps make navigating it easier.  As always we work together with the client as a team, communicating,  discussing, strategizing, and staying a step ahead to deliver superior results.
