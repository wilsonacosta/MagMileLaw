                                        <p>
                                            As a Yale University graduate and accomplished soccer player, I was very accustomed to high pressure situations. So, when it came time to decide on a professional career, I did not shy away from the challenge of practicing law or the responsibilities of representing clientele all across the country.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            16 years later, I have had the pleasure of representing a wide variety of clients – from Fortune 500 companies to local businesses to individual clients. In doing so, I have focused on a very simple, commonsense approach to how I handle cases. I don't B.S. my clients. I don't tell them what they want to hear. I don't make any promises that I know I can't keep. Rather, I provide them with a thorough work up of their file. I discuss with them all the strengths and weaknesses of their case. As a former defense attorney with years of experience representing corporate clients and insurance companies, I warn my clients about how the other side will defend their case. I explain what their options might be, what possible results they might be able to obtain, and what path to take to obtain the best possible result. I then guide my clients on that path, and, throughout the process, I treat judges and opposing counsel with courtesy, professionalism and respect.
                                        </p>
										<p>
                                            This approach has captured the attention of judges, jurors and clients alike. Judges have commented that I am "very talented," "well respected" and "someone who gets things done." I have had a client tell me that she was "so thankful" she found me; another client told me that that I'm one of the best lawyers she ever worked with. After my first solo jury trial, a group of jurors I spoke to after the trial were astonished to hear that I had never tried a case on my own before (they said I looked like a "seasoned pro"). A juror on another trial contacted me after trial to help her with her own legal issue.

I am licensed to practice in the State of Illinois, the Northern District of Illinois and the Southern District of Illinois.
