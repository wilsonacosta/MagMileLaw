                        <h3>About Mario Iveljic</h3>
                        <p>
							As a Yale University graduate and accomplished soccer player, I was very accustomed to high pressure situations. So, when it came time to decide on a professional career, I did not shy away from the challenge of practicing law or the responsibilities of representing clientele all across the country.
						</p>
						<p>
							16 years later, I have had the pleasure of representing a wide variety of clients – from Fortune 500 companies to local businesses to individual clients. In doing so, I have focused on a very simple, commonsense approach to how I handle cases. I don't B.S. my clients. I don't tell them what they want to hear. I don't make any promises that I know I can't keep. Rather, I provide them with a thorough work up of their file. I discuss with them all the strengths and weaknesses of their case. As a former defense attorney with years of experience representing corporate clients and insurance companies, I warn my clients about how the other side will defend their case. I explain what their options might be, what possible results they might be able to obtain, and what path to take to obtain the best possible result. I then guide my clients on that path, and, throughout the process, I treat judges and opposing counsel with courtesy, professionalism and respect.
						</p>
						<p>
							This approach has captured the attention of judges, jurors and clients alike. Judges have commented that I am "very talented," "well respected" and "someone who gets things done." I have had a client tell me that she was "so thankful" she found me; another client told me that that I'm one of the best lawyers she ever worked with. After my first solo jury trial, a group of jurors I spoke to after the trial were astonished to hear that I had never tried a case on my own before (they said I looked like a "seasoned pro"). A juror on another trial contacted me after trial to help her with her own legal issue.
						</p>
						<p>
							I have extensive experience in personal injury litigation, commercial litigation, mechanic's liens, real estate transactions/litigation, fraud litigation, and general litigation. I am licensed to practice in the State of Illinois, the Northern District of Illinois and the Southern District of Illinois. I have made my living in the courtrooms of Cook County, Illinois - but I have also been admitted to practice law in specific cases in several states across the country. I have had considerable success at trial and have also negotiated many favorable settlements on behalf of my clients.
						</p>
						<p>
							I would welcome the opportunity to put my experience to work for you. You'll find that I am an attorney you will swear by, and not at.

                            What's my goal? To get deals done. Nothing more. Many lawyers are notorious for 'killing' deals due to their overzealous representation of their clients.

                            I believe litigation is the last option. If possible, I always first calmly seek affable compromise in any dispute. But when compromise fails, I strike and strike hard to achieve my client's goals...<br><a href="./StevenMikuzis">Learn More</a>
