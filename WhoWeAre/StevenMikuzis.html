                        <h3>About Steven Mikuzis</h3>
                        <p>
							I believe litigation is the last option. If possible, I always first calmly seek affable compromise in any dispute. But when compromise fails, I strike and strike hard to achieve my client's goals.
						</p>
						<p>
							I first chaired my first 12 person jury trial as a first year associate at a large Chicago law firm. As the trial approached, the senior partner on the case became ill and was unable to appear. With no trial experience and little legal experience, I obtained a successful verdict for my client. My lack of legal experience at the time was shored up by my ability to connect with 12 diverse citizens of Cook County.
						</p>
						<p>
							Since that case I have tried multiple cases to verdict and appeal; sometimes representing the plaintiff and sometimes the defendant. I have tried cases involving personal injury, breach of contract, business disputes & fraud. I have tried cases against lawyers from one-man shops, national recognized law firms and legends of my profession. As my knowledge base has grown with these experiences, I have come to realize one thing: when trial comes you want me in that courtroom. You want me by your side. You want me to explain to the trier of fact why you were wronged and how they can make it right.
						</p>
						<p>
							I have the luxury of choosing the cases I wish to take. If I take your case, it is because I believe in you and your cause. I cannot sit here and tell you I have won every case that has come to me. No lawyer can. But as your lawyer I pledge my loyalty and will relentlessly pursue your interests. We become partners in your case. Your problem becomes my problem. And I will see it through to the very end.
