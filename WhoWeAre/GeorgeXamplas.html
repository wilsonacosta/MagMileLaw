                        <p>
                            I believe success starts and ends with knowing who I represent, why I am representing them, and what it is we are up against. To me, this means more than just the facts-it means understanding the person-top to bottom, inside and out. My clients come from all walks of life and all different socio-economic circles, from Fortune 100 CEOs to person's living in Chicago's homeless shelters.  But one thing they all share is the need for help and the need to be heard.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Born and raised in Chicagoland and growing up working in my family's small businesses, I learned fist hand the important life lessons of hard work and the vital need to listen and be fully engaged with the client. Add to this the fact that my formal education, anchored in science and the law, is as varied as it comes, I provide personal and professional legal services that meet and exceed my diverse clientele's highest expectations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My practice is international. I have successfully represented clients from six continents on matters ranging from litigation to real estate and have experienced an enormous amount of legal issues over my career.  However, the most important thing I have learned is that behind each and every case is an unique individual whose backgrounds and life experiences must be fully considered and taken into account when I work on their case.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I take this wholistic approach with each and every file. It allows me to see and consider solutions that others may not even imagine. I win because I think outside of the box; I think outside of the box because I listen to my client. <span style="font-style: italic;">I listen because it is necessary-our diversity demands it.</span>
                        </p>

                            We are on the same team. The law is not about me, the other side, or the other attorney, its about us. We work together. We succeed together. We win together.

                            What's my goal? To get deals done. Nothing more. Many lawyers are notorious for 'killing' deals due to their overzealous representation of their clients. They tend to bog down negotiations with unnecessary arguments and take stubborn positions. Not me...<br><a href="./MichaelBalourdos">Learn More</a>

                            I believe litigation is the last option. If possible, I always first calmly seek affable compromise in any dispute. But when compromise fails, I strike and strike hard to achieve my client's goals...<br><a href="./StevenMikuzis">Learn More</a>
